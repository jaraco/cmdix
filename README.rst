cmdix is a pure Python implementation of various standard UNIX commands,
like 'ls', 'cp' and 'sleep'. It also contains a shell-like environment which
will make Unix-users feel right at home on the Windows command-prompt.

Forked from the abandoned `pycoreutils project
<https://pypi.org/project/pycoreutils>`_ by Hans van Leeuwen.
